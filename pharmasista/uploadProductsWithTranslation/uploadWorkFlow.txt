Export product data
Run your SQL query in phpMyAdmin to export a CSV/JSON of:


SELECT
  pm.post_id AS product_id,
  pm.meta_value AS sku,
  t.trid
FROM wp_postmeta pm
JOIN wp_icl_translations t
  ON t.element_id = pm.post_id
  AND t.element_type = 'post_product'
WHERE pm.meta_key = '_sku'
  AND (pm.meta_value LIKE 'ar\_%' OR pm.meta_value LIKE 'en\_%');


product_id
sku
trid
Generate UPDATE SQL statements
Use a script (Node.js or Python) to:

Match ar_ and en_ SKUs by number.
Only generate an update if the Arabic and English products have different trids.
Output a .sql file with only needed UPDATEs.
Import the SQL file via phpMyAdmin
Use the Import tab to upload your .sql file and execute all updates at once.

Repeatability
If you run this process again, the script will skip products already linked (same trid), so itâ€™s idempotent and safe for multiple runs.
