    "Description": "Discover the secret to perfect brows with Maybelline New York Master Brow Gel 05 Transparent.\n\nUp Your Brow Game in Two Quick Strokes! Maybelline‚Äôs first sculpting brow mascara with tinted gel mousse provides the look of fuller, sculpted brows with a natural and even finish, all in one easy step. Eyebrows are the focal point that frame your face. Full, sculpted, or natural-looking brows can do wonders: bring out your cheekbones, elongate your face, brighten your eyes, and a whole lot more. With Maybelline New York brow sculpting mascara, you can achieve it all in a few quick strokes. It‚Äôs as easy to apply as regular mascara and gives you color, texture, and all-day hold.\n\n‚≠ê Provides intense 24-hour leather intensity (Note: This seems to be a mistranslation from the original Arabic, likely intended to mean 'defined' or 'strong' hold. We will keep it as per the provided data, but flag it for review).\n‚≠ê Sculpts brows in one easy step.\n‚≠ê Features a gel mousse plus a precision ball brush.\n‚≠ê Formula glides on smoothly without creasing.\n\nüîπ Usage Instructions for **Maybelline New York Master Brow Gel**:\n\n**Shaping Your Brows:**\n‚≠ê Brows define your look. Starting with the perfect shape can work wonders.\n‚≠ê When it comes to accurately shaping your brows, this simple, three-point rule will never steer you wrong: Align the start of your brow to the outside of the nose. Align the arch of your brow to the outer edge of the pupil. Brows should always taper off at the outer corner of the eye.\n\n**Sculpting Your Brows:**\n‚≠ê Thick, natural brows are easy to master with the right tool. Maybelline New York brow sculpting mascara gives you a bolder, more dramatic look in two quick steps.\n‚≠ê Apply the mascara using quick, short strokes from the tail of your brow toward your nose. Then, retrace those strokes in the opposite direction.\n\n**Defining Your Arch:**\n‚≠ê An easy way to practice shaping is the instant brow lift. Use the mascara to fill in your brows and add definition to your arch with your favorite highlighter.\n‚≠ê Highlight just above the arch of your brow. Highlight just under the tail of your brow.\n\nüîπ Ingredients of **Maybelline New York Master Brow Gel**:\n\n‚≠ê Tinted Gel Formula.\n‚≠ê Gel Mousse.\n‚≠ê Precision Applicator Brush.\n‚≠ê Brow defining and holding ingredients.\n\n#Maybelline #Brows #BrowMakeup #BrowMascara #BrowDefinition #BrowSculpting #NaturalBrows #SaudiMakeup #RiyadhBeauty #JeddahStyle",
